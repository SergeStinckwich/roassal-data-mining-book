!More graphs and multiple variables

This chapter is about investigations on multiple variables in the same of our data set. We will then present this investigations using the proper graphs.

@@note more about covariance can be found on a more detailed document: NumericalMethods, see Introduction, the classes implemented in this Document are going to be needed available at https://github.com/SergeStinckwich/SciSmalltalk
